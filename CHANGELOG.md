# Changelog

All notable changes to Rayfish are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Aliases and groups in `ray apply`** — a spec can now define optional
  top-level `aliases:` (a friendly name → a user's identity string) and
  `groups:` (a name → a list of aliases and/or hostnames), then reference them
  as firewall subjects or peers instead of listing every hostname. An alias
  names a person and expands to all of that person's currently-joined devices;
  a group expands to the union of its members. Expansion happens client-side at
  apply time, so the published rules are plain per-host suggestions. Aliases
  resolve only for members that have already joined (a `note:` is printed and
  the rule skipped until they do); literal hostnames still work before a host
  joins. `ray apply --dry-run` shows the fully expanded result.
- **`ray identityof <net> <host>`** — print a host's identity string (the value
  to paste into a spec's `aliases:`). Resolves to the user identity if the
  device is paired, else the device's transport identity. `--json` supported.
- **`ray ping <peer>`** — active mesh diagnostics: sends live echo probes to a
  peer (by hostname, mesh IP, or short id) and reports per-probe round-trip
  latency, packet loss, and whether the path is direct or relayed. `-c/--count`
  and `-i/--interval` tune the probe run; `--json` emits the per-probe array.
  Unlike `ray status` (a passive snapshot), this verifies the round-trip works
  end to end.
- **`ray netcheck`** — local network diagnostics: bound UDP port (and whether
  it is the fixed forwardable port or an ephemeral fallback), home relay and its
  latency, public IPv4/IPv6 addresses, and whether UDP is working. `--json`
  supported.
- **Release notes on `ray update`** — before swapping the binary (and in
  `ray update --check` when behind), print what the update brings: the stable
  channel walks every release in `(current, latest]` newest-first, while
  `--nightly`/`--version` show the resolved release's notes. Best-effort, so a
  fetch failure never blocks the update.
- **Standby control plane (`ray up`/`down`)** — `ray down` now takes only the
  data plane offline (TUN, routes, Magic DNS, inbound forward gate) while staying
  connected to peers, so the node keeps receiving roster/blob/firewall updates and
  `ray up` is near-instant with no re-dial. `sudo ray start`/`stop` remain the
  fully-offline switch.
- **Fail-fast firewall REJECT mode** — `ray firewall reject on|off` (opt-in,
  default off): a denied packet gets a TCP RST / ICMP-unreachable reply in both
  directions so the initiator fails immediately ("connection refused") instead of
  hanging. Off keeps the stealthy silent-drop posture.
- **`ray start` / `ray stop`** service commands to bring the whole daemon online
  or fully offline.
- **Comma-list firewall ports + short CLI aliases** — `--port`/`-P` takes a
  single port, a `start-end` range, or a comma list (`80,443`, `22,8000-9000`)
  expanded to one rule per item.
- **Control-plane abuse defense** — per-connection token-bucket rate limiting that
  closes sustained flooders, with a per-network debounced reconverge worker so a
  trigger burst coalesces into a single pkarr resolve + reconverge.

### Changed

- **Richer daemon log files** — the rolling daily logs (bundled by `ray report`)
  now capture `debug`-level detail for Rayfish itself while the console stays at
  `info`, so diagnostics like hostname propagation are traceable in a report
  without re-running with `RUST_LOG`. Dependency logs stay at `info`; `RUST_LOG`
  still overrides everything.
- **Additive firewall suggestions** — each suggested token becomes one allow/deny
  rule with no synthesized catch-all (allow-list relies on the node's own inbound
  default-deny; denies-only = blacklist). `ray status` ends with a `pending`
  summary of things awaiting the user.

### Fixed

- **Accepted firewall suggestions no longer pile up duplicates.** Any change to a
  network's signed blob (a join, a rename, a new reusable key) re-materialized the
  whole suggested-firewall set and re-queued it for review, even the rules this
  node had already accepted. Accepting one of those repeats via the picker then
  appended a second identical rule. Already-installed suggestions are now kept out
  of the pending queue, and the picker merges by selector (newest wins), so a
  re-suggested rule replaces its predecessor instead of stacking.
- **`ray update` no longer bricks the system service.** After swapping its own
  binary, `ray update` rewrote the service unit using the path of the running
  executable, which Linux reports with a trailing `" (deleted)"` once the old
  binary is unlinked. The unit ended up as `ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ray (deleted)
  daemon`, so the daemon crash-looped with `unrecognized subcommand '(deleted)'`
  and the node went offline until a manual reinstall. The path is now sanitized,
  making remote self-update safe.
- **`ray hostname` rename now reliably propagates.** A member's rename is kept as
  a durable pending intent and re-delivered to a coordinator on every reconnect
  and reconverge until the signed roster confirms it, so the new name reaches the
  coordinator and all peers instead of sticking only on the renamed node. The
  renamed node keeps showing its new name across reconverges rather than briefly
  reverting to the old one.
- **`ray status` no longer shows `?` for a live connection's path.** A connection
  that is up but whose path iroh hasn't marked "selected" yet (during holepunch or
  migration) now reports its actual `direct`/`relay`/`tor` path instead of `?`.
- **`ray status` no longer glues a network's `join <room-id>` onto the last peer
  row.** The room-id line now prints on its own line.
- Publish the contact record regardless of data-plane state, so `ray connect`
  resolves a peer that is on standby (`ray down`).

## [0.1.2]

### Changed

- **Magic DNS reworked to TUN interception** — `.ray` queries are intercepted in
  the TUN read loop and answered in-daemon via the magic IP `100.100.100.53`, so
  the resolver never binds the host's port 53. Non-`.ray` queries forward to the
  captured upstreams.
- **Direct-mode DNS takeover (Tailscale-style)** — on hosts without split-DNS,
  take over `/etc/resolv.conf` with an inotify re-assert loop that repairs it in
  ~ms when NetworkManager/dhclient overwrites it, plus a `dns=none` NM drop-in so
  NM stops regenerating it. Both are marker-guarded and crash-safe (panic hook +
  next-start cleanup restore the host's DNS).
- **Sharded, atomic per-network config** — globals in `settings.toml`, each
  network in `networks/<name>.toml`, all written via temp-file + atomic rename.
  Replaces the single `networks.toml` whose non-atomic rewrites raced and silently
  dropped networks; legacy files auto-migrate on first load.
- Retain only the 7 most recent daily log files.
- Authenticate GitHub API calls in `ray update` with a `gh` token (lifts the
  anonymous rate limit).

### Fixed

- Scope suggested firewall rules to non-joined networks correctly, and default a
  suggestion's peer to "any" so rules propagate instantly.
- Point systemd-resolved (`SetLinkDNS`) at the magic IP; fix the NetworkManager
  mode read on Linux.

## [0.1.1]

### Added

- **Direct connections (`ray connect`)** — link two peers with no shared room id
  or invite via a rotatable, published **contact id**. `ray connect <contact-id>`
  sends a friend request; `ray connections [approve <id>]` reviews and admits it,
  minting a 2-peer network with the requester pre-approved. `ray contact
  [id|rotate]` prints or rotates the contact key.
- **Reusable invite keys** — `ray invite <net> --reusable [--expires]` mints a
  multi-use, expiring key that rides the signed `GroupBlob`, for unattended
  fleets (`ray join <key> --hostname H --auto-accept-firewall`). Revocation
  propagates via the blob.
- **Cross-coordinator invite gossip** — single-use invites are gossiped
  (`InviteShare`/`InviteUsed`) so any coordinator can validate and burn a
  cross-minted invite; combined with dial-fallback across the published
  coordinator set, fresh joins survive any single coordinator being offline.
- **Self-update (`ray update`)** — update from GitHub releases with SHA-256
  verification and atomic binary swap; `--check`, `--list`, `--force`,
  `--nightly` (rolling pre-release), and `--version V` (pinned, downgrades
  allowed). `ray version` / `--version` print the compiled version + git SHA.
- **Stable listen port** — the shared endpoint binds a fixed UDP port (41383) so
  it survives restarts and can be manually port-forwarded for guaranteed direct
  reachability, falling back to an ephemeral port if the port is in use.
- **CLI polish** — ANSI-aligned tables, progress spinners, an interactive
  `ray firewall pending` picker, and a global `--json` flag for machine-readable
  output.
- **Per-node firewall auto-accept** — `ray join --auto-accept-firewall` /
  `ray firewall auto-accept <net> on|off` to auto-install suggested rules.
- **IPv4 collision handling** — per-member `collision_index` with `assign_ip`
  rotation, index-aware validation, duplicate-IP rejection, and a deterministic
  reconverge tiebreak.
- **Opt-in QR invites** — `ray invite --qr` prints a scannable code.

### Changed

- **Secure-by-default inbound firewall** — unsolicited inbound TCP/UDP is now
  denied by default (inbound ICMP allowed, outbound allowed), with a stateful
  conntrack letting return traffic pass. `ray firewall default allow|deny` flips
  the inbound default.
- **Removed `trusted` networks** in favor of per-device, per-network firewall
  auto-accept; coordinators suggest rules on any network and nodes consent
  per-node (auto-accept or manual `ray firewall accept`/`deny`).
- **`ray apply` is YAML-only** (previously YAML/TOML/JSON), with each network
  mapping directly to its firewall subjects.
- **Mesh ALPN is versioned as the protocol-compatibility gate** — peers on
  different mesh versions share no common ALPN and can't connect. `ray join`
  pre-checks the coordinator's signed mesh version and dials surface an
  incompatible-version hint suggesting `ray update`.
- Roster and firewall state reconverge from the network-key-signed pkarr record,
  not from peer control messages (which are payload-free triggers).

### Fixed

- **ICMP conntrack** is now echo-type-aware, closing an inbound leak where reply
  packets could be treated as solicited.
- macOS routing — assert the IPv4 `100.64.0.0/10` route on activate, and install
  a loopback self-route so you can ping your own `*.ray` IP.
- Flush control-protocol QUIC streams and the pairing device-cert response so
  messages always reach the peer before the connection drops.
- `AdminGrant` keys are self-authenticated against the network public key.

### Performance

- Zero-copy TUN read and datagram forwarding path, with Criterion microbenchmarks
  (`benches/forward.rs`) over the per-packet data path.

## [0.1.0]

First public release.

### Added

- **P2P mesh VPN** over [iroh](https://iroh.computer) — peers connect by
  cryptographic identity (EndpointId), not IP. NAT traversal, hole-punching, and
  end-to-end encryption are handled by iroh, with encrypted relay fallback.
- **Dual-stack addressing** derived from identity: stable IPv4 in `100.64.0.0/10`
  (FNV-1a) and stable IPv6 in `200::/7` (blake3, 120-bit, never rotates).
- **Networks & access modes** — closed by default; `--open` for public networks.
  Closed networks admit via one-time **invite codes** (`ray invite`) or **live
  approval** (`ray requests` / `ray accept` / `ray deny`). The room id is a
  discovery key, never an admission credential.
- **Coordinator / membership model** — single signed `GroupBlob` per network
  published to a per-network pkarr record; gatekeeper admission, member roster,
  and `MemberApproved` broadcast so the coordinator need not be online for a
  member's later reconnects.
- **Co-coordinators** — `ray admin add` grants the network key over the
  authenticated mesh, enabling multiple machines to publish the signed blob.
- **Magic DNS** — reach peers at `name.network.ray` (A/AAAA/PTR/SOA), rebuilt
  from the roster on every membership change.
- **Per-device firewall** — directional, protocol-, port-, and network-scoped
  rules with a stateful conntrack; `firewall.toml`.
- **Trusted networks** — coordinators can suggest firewall rules that ride the
  signed blob; nodes auto-take (`--allow-trusted`) or queue them for manual
  `ray firewall accept` / `deny`.
- **Declarative provisioning** — `ray apply <spec>` reconciles trusted networks +
  suggested firewalls from a YAML/TOML/JSON spec, with `--prune`, `--dry-run`,
  `--invite-missing`, and `--example`.
- **Multi-device identity** — `ray pair` (ticket-based), plus encrypted
  backup/restore, including optional 1Password storage of the encrypted blob via
  the `op` CLI (`ray pair backup --1password` / `ray pair restore --1password`).
- **File sharing** — `ray send` / `ray files accept` over iroh-blobs.
- **mDNS local discovery** (`ray mdns on|off`, default on).
- **Service management** — `ray up`/`down`, `ray install`/`restart`/`uninstall`,
  and the Tailscale-style operator model (`ray set-operator`).
- **Audit log** — append-only peer connect/disconnect events at
  `~/.config/rayfish/audit.log`.
- **Diagnostics** — Prometheus metrics on `:9090`, rolling daily logs, and
  `ray report` to bundle logs + metrics + sanitized status.
- **Optional transports / export** — `--features tor` (Tor transport) and
  `--features otel` (OTLP span export).
